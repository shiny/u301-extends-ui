## Install
```bash
bun i chat-i18n
```

## Usage
First, put chat-i18n.toml file in your project root directory.

This is an example
```toml
# the locale message directory in your project
dir = "locales"
source = "en"

[provider]
# The name of the provider you are using. Currently, only "deekseek" is supported.
name = "deekseek"

[deekseek]
# Your Deekseeker API key
api_key = "sk-**"
```

Locale message files: `<any_locale_messages_dir>/<locale>.json`

- Only support json format locale messages.
- For incremental translation, we use git diff and json diff.


Second, edit and save your locale messages file, do not commit it to git.

Then, run the `bunx chat-i18n` command in your terminal to finish the translation.
